* User-friendly GUI with folder pickers and progress bar
* Real-time color-coded log output for each step
* Automatically deletes and replaces `1 Marketing` folder with a shortcut in the work folder

## 🖥️ How to Use

1. **Install dependencies** (once):

   ```bash
   pip install PySimpleGUI pywin32
   ```

2. **Run the app**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Enter inputs**:

   * Project Folder Name
   * Adjust default template and destination paths (optional)
   * Click **Run**

The tool logs and tracks each step as it:

* Copies the marketing template to `V:\2025\{Project Folder}`
* Copies the work template to `W:\2025\{Project Folder}`
* Deletes the `1 Marketing` folder in the work folder
* Replaces it with a shortcut to the `1 Marketing` folder in the marketing location

---

## 🔒 Requirements

* Windows OS (for shortcut creation via `pywin32`)
* Python 3.8 or newer

---

## 🛠 Build a Standalone .exe

To distribute without requiring Python:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed app.py
```

Output will be located in the `dist/` folder.

---

## ✅ Customization Ideas

* Save logs to `.txt` file
* Add dry-run / preview mode
* Extend with email notifications or integrations
